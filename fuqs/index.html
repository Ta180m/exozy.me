            <h2>Frequently Unasked Questions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Why the name?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Uh... not for any particular reason. It was just a cool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack">domain hack</a> with the .me domain, and it contains everyone's favorite math variables x, y, and z!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Can you install <i>X</i>?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If it's free and open-source, then most likely yes! Just ask on Matrix, as usual. I'm a bit stricter about proprietary software, but if you have a legitimate reason for it, then sure. If you just want to install the software for your own user, open up Discover and search for the app. If this doesn't work, for some reason, try running <i>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo --user</i>, then <i>flatpak install APPNAME --user</i>. <a href="https://www.appimagehub.com/">AppImage</a> also works.

            <p>
                <b>How many cores, memory, and disk space am I allowed to use?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll be delighted to hear that there's no hard limit! However, you should generally be courteous about the other users, so try not to use more than 4 cores and 50GB of our fast NVME storage. For RAM, try not to use more than 4GB, and don't give your VMs much more memory than they need. You can run intensive commands with <i>nice [NUMBER]</i>, where a higher number will cause it to be less disruptive to other users' work. If you need more storage, ask me about it on Matrix and I can give you up to 500GB of HDD storage. Of course, if you absolutely need more of any resource, we can have a chat about it on Matrix.

                <b>Why is the connection speed so slow?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Blame the ISPs. The my ISP's download speed is quite fast, but its upload speed is horrendous. This translates to a low download speed for users like you. Most people have slow upload speeds too, so that makes the connection slow both ways. I really should contact my ISP about it...

            <p>
                <b>Can the admins see everything I do?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, unless you encrypt it! Matrix direct messages are encrypted by default, but Nextcloud is not, for better performance. No problem though, since you can use things like <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/">cryfs</a> or <a href="https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/">gocryptfs</a> to encrypt your files. The KDE Plasma desktop also has a nice Vaults feature in the system tray for encryption.

            <p>
                <b>Can I have sudo privileges?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Probably not, unless you have a seriously legitimate reason for it. The exception is if I'm on vacation or something and designate someone as a temporary admin.

                <b>Help! I forgot my password to <i>X</i> and the reset password thing doesn't work!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Shoot me a message about it on Matrix and I can get it fixed.

                <b>I need help with something!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You know the drill: ask on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:exozy.me">Matrix</a>!
