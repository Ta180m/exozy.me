            <p>
                <b>I've joined exozyme, now what?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Great that you asked! Get started by logging in with SSH on port 4884 and make yourself at home. We have a number of <a href="https://exozy.me/services/">services</a>, and if you want to try one of them, just ask on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:exozy.me">Matrix</a>. You can also try out our fast virtual machines and containers.

                <b>How can I run graphical apps?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The easiest way (at least for Linux users) is X11 forwarding with <i>ssh -X</i>. If you need 3D graphical acceleration, you can use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VirtualGL">VirtualGL</a> with <i>vglclient</i> to connect with SSH and <i>vglrun</i> to run apps.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>What about a full-blown remote desktop?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                We've set up <a href="http://xrdp.org/">xrdp</a> for this, which you can connect to on port 3388 with an RDP client. For example, with <a href="https://www.freerdp.com/">FreeRDP</a>, use <i>xfreerdp /v:exozy.me:3388 /dynamic-resolution /sound</i>. You may need to run <i>pulseaudio</i> in the desktop for sound to work. For these desktop sessions, you can also use <i>vglrun</i> to run apps with 3D acceleration. You can even run games, although the GPU isn't that good. If you would like to use VNC or X2Go instead, just ask me on Matrix and I'll get it set up.

            <p>
                <b>Can I host my own website?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes! Just remember that this server is down for part of the day. You can use exozyme pages to host your website simply by creating a new folder with your username in <i>/srv/http/pages</i> and adding your content to that folder. Now go to <a href="https://exozy.me/~username">exozy.me/~username</a> to see your new website in action! If you need a subdomain instead like <a href=https://ta180m.exozy.me/>ta180m.exozy.me</a>, I can get one set up for you too.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Can you install <i>X</i>?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If it's free and open-source, then most likely yes! Just ask on Matrix, as usual. I'm a bit stricter about proprietary software, but if you have a legitimate reason for it, then sure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>How many cores or how much disk space am I allowed to use?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll be delighted to hear that there's no hard limit! However, you should generally be courteous about the other users, so try not to use more than 4 cores and 50GB of our fast NVME storage. You can also run intensive commands with <i>nice [NUMBER]</i>, where a higher number will cause it to be less disruptive to other users' work. If you need more storage, ask me about it on Matrix and I can give you up to 500GB of HDD storage. Of course, if you absolutely need more than this, we can have a chat about it on Matrix.

                <b>Why is the connection speed so slow?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Blame the ISPs. The my ISP's download speed is quite fast, but its upload speed is horrendous. This translates to a low download speed for users like you. Most people have slow upload speeds too, so that makes the connection slow both ways. I really should contact my ISP about it...

            <p>
                <b>Can the admins see everything I do?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, unless you encrypt it! Matrix direct messages are encrypted by default, but Nextcloud is not, for better performance. No problem though, since you can use things like <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/">cryfs</a> or <a href="https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/">gocryptfs</a> to encrypt your files. The KDE Plasma desktop also has a nice Vaults feature in the system tray for encryption.

            <p>
                <b>Can I have sudo privileges?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Probably not, unless you have a seriously legitimate reason for it. The exception is if I'm on vacation or something and designate someone as a temporary admin.

                <b>I need help with something!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You know the drill: ask on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:exozy.me">Matrix</a>!
