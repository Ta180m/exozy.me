                <b>Why the name?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Uh... not for any particular reason. It was just a cool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack">domain hack</a> with the .me domain, and it contains everyone's favorite math variables x, y, and z!

            <p>
                Please report it on our <a href="https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/issues">bug tracker</a>. We really appreciate it!

                <b>Help! I forgot my password and the reset password thing doesn't work!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Shoot me a message about it on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!dRcbHQEbbDRNcYShLo:exozy.me?via=exozy.me&via=matrix.org">Matrix</a> and I can get it reset.

                <b>How many cores, memory, and disk space am I allowed to use?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll be delighted to hear that there's no hard limit! Of course, you should still be courteous to the other users, so try not to use more than 4 cores and 50GB of our fast NVME storage. For RAM, 4GB should be enough for most things, and remember not to give your VMs more memory than they need. If you need to run an intensive command, prefix it with <i>nice [NUMBER]</i>, where a higher number will cause it to be less disruptive to other users. Need more of a resource, such as 500GB of HDD storage? Ask about it on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!dRcbHQEbbDRNcYShLo:exozy.me?via=exozy.me&via=matrix.org">Matrix</a>.

                <b>Can you install something for me?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If it's an app, chances are, you can install it yourself! Try opening up Discover in a remote desktop session and searching for the app. If that doesn't work, we can help you on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!dRcbHQEbbDRNcYShLo:exozy.me?via=exozy.me&via=matrix.org">Matrix</a>.

                <b>Why's the connection speed so slow?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Blame the ISPs. The my ISP's download speed is quite fast, but its upload speed is horrendous. This translates to a low download speed for users like you. Most people have slow upload speeds too, so that makes the connection slow both ways. Not much I can do about it, sorry.

                <b>Can the admins see everything I do?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, unless you encrypt it! Matrix direct messages are encrypted by default, but Nextcloud is not, for better performance. No problem though, since you can use things like <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/">cryfs</a> or <a href="https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/">gocryptfs</a> to encrypt your files. The KDE Plasma desktop also has a nice Vaults feature in the system tray for file encryption.

                <b>What kind of data does exozyme collect?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't collect any more data than what Arch Linux does by default, such as your IP address. Your data is never saved to anywhere else except on the exozyme server and no one can see it except for the server admins. If you decide to delete your account, we will delete all of your data on the server.

                <b>The command line is behaving weirdly, commands I copied from the internet don't work, editing my <i>~/.bashrc</i> isn't working, and I can't change my shell!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                These issues are all consequences of using <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> as the default shell for new users instead of the typical Bash. Although Fish is much easier to use than Bash, it's also not very compatible with Bash commands. You probably shouldn't blindly copy commands from the internet, but if you do, run <i>bash</i> first to get a Bash shell before pasting them in. If you want to run commands when starting the shell as with a <i>~/.bashrc</i>, see <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/211529">this Stack Exchange post</a>. And if you get tired of fish, just ask about changing your shell on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!dRcbHQEbbDRNcYShLo:exozy.me?via=exozy.me&via=matrix.org">Matrix</a>.
