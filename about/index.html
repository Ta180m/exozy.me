                Unfortunately due to our <a href="https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/issues/13">limited funding</a>, <b>we cannot provide any uptime guarantees</b>. We'll try to keep the server <a href="https://exozyme.github.io/">up between 7:30 to 22:30 CST</a>, but there may be occasional reboots for maintainence and other outages.

            <h3>Our server</h3>
            <p>
                Want the juicy technical details? The server's currently equiped with a 24-thread AMD Ryzen 9 5900X proccessor paired with 2011's finest ATI Radeon HD 6570 graphics card, along with 32GB of RAM. The graphics card will be upgraded soon...™

                Arch Linux is a terrible OS for servers, but we use it anyways and update every week on Friday night. If Arch isn't your thing, you can also spin up a VM or container for another OS.
