                <b>exozyme is completely free to use!</b> However, there are no uptime guarentees. The server is usually <a href="https://exozyme.github.io/">up between 8:30 to 22:30 CST</a>, but it could go down at any time.

            <h3>Technical details</h3>
            <p>
                If you're interested in the technical details, the server uses a 6-core 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 5600X proccessor paired with the 2011's finest ATI Radeon HD 6570 graphics card. We currently only have 16GB of RAM, but plenty of swap space so you don't have to worry about running out of memory. The server runs Arch Linux, updated every week on Saturday night, but you can use a virtual machine or container to run a different OS if you would like.
