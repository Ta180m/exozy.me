            <h3>Join us!</h3>
            <p>
                Interested in exozyme? You can get started by emailing <a href="mailto:join@exozy.me">join@exozy.me</a> and introducing yourself and what you plan to do with exozyme. Please also mention what you want your username to be. We may ask a few follow-up questions, and once everything is figured out, we'll get you an exozyme account set up right away!

            <h3>Logging in</h3>
            <p>
                OK, so you've joined exozyme! You can start by logging into your remote exozyme desktop with the <a href="https://desk.exozy.me">exodesk</a> web client. (If you want to use a RDP client app, check out the <a href="https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/wiki/Remote-desktop-clients">wiki</a>) Anyways, you should see a login screen, and type in your exozyme username and password. You'll be dropped into a desktop, which might take a few seconds to load properly. Enjoy your exozyme desktop!
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                The first thing you should do is open up a terminal and <b>change your password</b>. The easiest way to do this is by searching for "terminal" in the application menu in the bottom left corner. Now change your password with the <i>passwd</i> command. If you want to run apps, note that the GPU currently isn't that good, so games may not work well. Also, please <b>remember to log out</b> when you are done which you can do by searching for "logout" in the application menu.
            </p>

            <h3>Enter the Matrix</h3>
            <p>
                You can chat with your friends on <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> and other networks including <a href="/blog/dont-use-discord">Discord</a> using your <b>exochat</b> account. To start, go to your exocloud home page and click on the <a href="https://cloud.exozy.me/apps/riotchat/">Element app</a> on the top. (exochat is powered by Matrix, so you can use any <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/">Matrix client</a>, but remember to change the homeserver to use <a href="https://chat.exozy.me">chat.exozy.me</a> instead of matrix.org) Now sign in with your exozyme username and password as usual, and welcome to your shiny new exochat account!

                Let's join some rooms and spaces (groups of rooms) now. You'll definitely want to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!dRcbHQEbbDRNcYShLo:exozy.me?via=exozy.me&via=matrix.org">exozyme space</a> and hang out, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#offtopic:matrix.org">#offtopic</a> is another fun one. One of Matrix's most ambitious goals is to <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/">bridge its network to as many others as possible</a>, so you might want to check out our <a href="https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/wiki/Bridge-Discord-and-Matrix">wiki</a> for instructions on bridging Discord to Matrix.

            <h3>SSH</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't need a desktop, you can also log in to a terminal with SSH. For help using the terminal, check out <a href="https://exozy.me/howtuwu/linux/terminal/">this guide</a>. If you want to run graphical apps, you can use X11 forwarding with <i>ssh -X</i>. Note that this works best with a Linux client; otherwise, <a href="https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/x-forwarding-mac-and-windows">follow these instructions</a>.

            <h3>Hosting your first website</h3>
            <p>
                Want to host a website on exozyme? Fortunately, it's incredibly easy and only takes two minutes! Open up the file explorer in your remote desktop or log in with SSH. Now navigate to the <i>/srv/http/pages/users</i> folder. Create a new folder named your username which will hold the content for your new website. Make an actual page by creating a file called <i>index.html</i> and write some text. If you open up <a href="https://exozy.me/~USERNAME">https://exozy.me/~USERNAME</a>, you should see your website live in action!
