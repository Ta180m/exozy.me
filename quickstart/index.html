            <h2>Get started!</h2>
            
            <h3>Join us!</h3>
            <p>
                Interested in exozyme? You can get started by joining our <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!dRcbHQEbbDRNcYShLo:exozy.me?via=exozy.me&via=matrix.org">space</a> and introducing yourself and what you plan to do with exozyme in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:exozy.me">#general:exozy.me<a/> room. We'll get an account for you set up right away!
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Logging in</h3>
            <p>
                OK, so you've joined exozyme! Now what? You can start with <b>exodesk</b> and access your exozyme desktop. You'll need an RDP remote desktop client. Linux users can use the FreeRDP client in their distro's repository, while Windows has a built-in client called Remote Desktop Connection. Mac users can use the <a href="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/rdmacios-k2vy/apps/microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac/distribution_groups/all-users-of-microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac">Microsoft Remote Desktop Beta client</a>. If your OS wasn't listed, check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients">this list</a>.
            </p>

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Alright, now spin up the client and connect to the address <i>exozy.me:3388</i>. You should see a login screen, where you'll type in your username and password for your exozyme account. If it all works, it should drop you into a desktop! It might take a few seconds to load properly. Enjoy your remote desktop!
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                The first thing you should do is open up a terminal and change your password. The easiest way to do this is by searching for "terminal" in the application menu in the bottom left corner. Now change your password with the <i>passwd</i> command. Note that the GPU currently isn't that good, so games may not work well. Also, please remember to log out when you are done.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>SSH</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't need a desktop, you can also log in to a terminal with SSH. For help using the terminal, check out <a href="https://exozy.me/howtuwu/linux/terminal/">this guide</a>. If you want to run graphical apps, you can use X11 forwarding with <i>ssh -X</i>. Note that this works best with a Linux client; otherwise, <a href="https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/x-forwarding-mac-and-windows">follow these instructions</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Hosting your first website</h3>
            <p>
                Open up the file explorer in your remote desktop or log in with SSH. Now navigate to the <i>/srv/http/pages</i> folder. Create a new folder named your username which will hold the content for your new website. Now let's make an actual page. Create a file called <i>index.html</i> and write some text. If you open up <a href="https://exozy.me/~USERNAME">https://exozy.me/~USERNAME</a>, you should see your website in action! Check out <a href="/~pages/">exozyme pages</a> for more information about web hosting.

            <h3>Trying out exocloud</h3>
            <p>
                Try our powerful collaboration and productivity suite by going to <a href="https://cloud.exozy.me">exocloud</a> and logging in with your exozyme username and password. If things work out, you'll be taken to your exocloud homepage!
            </p>

            <p>
                So what can you do with exocloud? Well, judging by the sheer number of icons on the top bar, a lot! There's cloud storage, an email client, photo manager, music player, calendar, and an integrated Element Matrix client. Have fun!
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Enter the Matrix</h3>
            <p>
                You can chat with your friends on <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> and <a href="/blog/dont-use-discord">Discord</a> using your <b>exochat</b> account. You can start by opening up the <a href="https://app.element.io/">Element web client</a>. (You can also use the <a href="https://cloud.exozy.me/apps/riotchat/">integrated Element client</a> in Nextcloud or any other Matrix client) Now sign in, but change the homeserver to use <a href="https://chat.exozy.me">chat.exozy.me</a> instead of matrix.org. Type in your exozyme username and password as usual, and welcome to your shiny new Matrix account!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Let's join some rooms and spaces (groups of rooms) now. Definitely join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!dRcbHQEbbDRNcYShLo:exozy.me?via=exozy.me&via=matrix.org">exozyme space</a>, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#offtopic:matrix.org">#offtopic</a> is another fun one.

                One of Matrix's most ambitious goals is to <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/">bridge its network to as many others as possible</a>. It's an awesome goal, and we're hosting a Discord to Matrix bridge on exozyme. To use the bridge, start a chat with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@_discordpuppet_bot:exozy.me">the bridge bot</a>, and type <i>help</i> to see instructions. Now retrieve your Discord account token using <a href="https://discordhelp.net/discord-token">this method</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token">this one</a>. All you need to do now is type <i>link user YOURTOKEN</i> to the bot and enjoy the bridge!
