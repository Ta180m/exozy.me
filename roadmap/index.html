                Running exozyme is expensive. I probably need to get something set up for this soon...

                <b>Upgrading the GPU</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, the old ATI Radeon HD 6570 is probably nearing the end of its lifespan. I'm thinking up upgrading to a Radeon RX 6600XT or 6700XT in the next few months. You'll finally be able to game at respectable framerates, if bandwidth allows, of course!

                <b>Upgrading the CPU</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our current CPU is quite a beast, but it would be nice to have a few more cores. A 5900X wouldn't cost that much more, but I'll have to sell the current CPU.

                <b>Upgrading the RAM</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                VMs tend to use a lot of memory. 16GB just isn't enough. Sure, we have lots of swap space so we won't easily run out of memory, but 32GB or 48GB would be a great upgrade.

                <b>Running the server at night</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                My power bill will suffer. Maybe once we figure out a better way to fund exozyme.

                <b>Email server</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hosting an email server is a massive pain. Maybe when I have an entire week of free time...

                <b>Storage</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our current SSD drive is awesome! However, it would be great to have a few hundred more GB of space, and the upgrade from PCIe 3.0 to PCIe 4.0 is nice. It might be a good idea to get a larger HDD too.
