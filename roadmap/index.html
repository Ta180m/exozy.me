            <p>
                Running exozyme is expensive. I probably need to get something set up for this soon...

                <b>Upgrading the GPU</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, the old ATI Radeon HD 6570 is probably nearing the end of its lifespan. I'm thinking up upgrading to a Radeon RX 6600XT in the next few months. You'll finally be able to game at respectable framerates!

                <b>Upgrading the CPU</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our current CPU is quite a beast, but it would be nice to have a few more cores.

                <b>Upgrading the RAM</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                VMs tend to use a lot of memory. 16GB just isn't enough. Sure, we have lots of swap space so we won't easily run out of memory, but 32GB would be a great upgrade.

                <b>Running the server at night</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                My power bill will suffer. Maybe once we figure out a better way to fund exozyme.

                <b>Email server</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hosting an email server is a massive pain. Maybe when I have an entire week of free time...
